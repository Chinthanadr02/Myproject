In today's digital age, the demand for converting physical documents into electronic format is 
ever-increasing, driven by the need for efficient storage, easy access, and streamlined workflows. 
This project presents the development of an Automatic Document Scanner utilizing OpenCV, an 
open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. The proposed system is 
designed to automate the process of scanning documents, ensuring high accuracy and efficiency.
The core functionality of the scanner includes image acquisition, preprocessing, edge detection, 
perspective transformation, and image enhancement. By leveraging OpenCV's robust image 
processing algorithms, the system can effectively detect document edges, correct perspective 
distortions, and enhance the final scanned image for improved readability. Additionally, the 
implementation includes automatic cropping and background removal to produce a clean, 
professional-quality digital document.
The scanner is tested on various types of documents, including text pages, forms, and receipts, 
demonstrating its versatility and reliability. Experimental results indicate that the system 
performs with high precision, offering a cost-effective and accessible solution for individuals and 
organizations looking to digitize their paperwork. Overall, this project showcases the potential of 
using OpenCV for developing a powerful and user-friendly automatic document scanning 
solution, contributing to advancements in document management technologies.
